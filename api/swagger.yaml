    ## PoS  V10 API\n\nThe API is split into 5 categories: \n* **Brands**: Look up\
    \ brands or stores based on brand \n* **PointOfSales**: Management of Point of\
    \ Sales including create, delete and querying. Note that a Point of Sale is not\
    \ editable. \n* **Refunds**: Everything needed in order to do a refund (create,\
    \ cancel and look up) \n* **Stores**: Look up store information \n* **Payments**:\
    \ Everything needed in order to initiate and complete a payment. \n\n#### Payment\
    \ flows\nPayments can be started in two ways: as an initiated payment that is\
    \ immediatedly ready for user approval or as a prepared payment that is not yet\
    \ ready for user approval and must be explicitly marked as ready. Once a payment\
    \ is ready for user approval, it is issued to the user. Once the user accepts\
    \ the payment request, and the payment amount has been reserved, the payment must\
    \ be captured to complete the payment.\n\nThe API thus supports the following\
    \ two payment flows:\n* Initiate payment (POST /payments) --> poll until reserved\
    \ (GET /payments/{paymentId}) --> capture (POST /payments/{paymentId}/capture)\
    \ \n* Prepare payment (POST /payments/prepare) --> mark as ready (POST /payments/{paymentId}/ready)\
    \ --> poll until reserved (GET /payments/{paymentId}) --> capture (POST /payments/{paymentId}/capture)"
